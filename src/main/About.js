              <p className='content1'>   Our School Establish in 2001 since......"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
                   so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; 
                   and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, 
                   which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. 
                   These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. 
                   In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, 
                   every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. 
                   But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will

                  <h2 className='innerheading'> Our Origin And History </h2>
                <p className='content1'>The school’s founder, S. R. Das, was educated at Manchester Grammar School, a highly academic and prestigious all boys’ 
                school founded in 1515 in England. On his return to India, where he served as the Advocate General
                 of Bengal and a member of the Viceroy’s Executive Council of Lord Irwin, he set out to create 
                 and establish a school based on the British private boarding school model, but one for Indian 
                 boys in India. He wanted them to receive the same educational opportunities he had experienced 
                 at Manchester Grammar but without having to leave their home country. S. R. Das aspired to set up 
                 a school which was open to all, unlike the majority of the then existing boarding schools that a
                 dmitted only British pupils and were Christian in ethos, or which served India’s wealthy elites. 
                 The Doon School was envisioned as a school that would attract boys from all sections of Indian 
                 society, and from every state in India, and would be entirely secular. The Doon School was to 
                 specialize in the education of boys who would go on to serve a free and democratic India. The 
                 first Headmaster was Arthur Foot, a science master from Eton College. His deputy, John Martyn,
                  who was a Housemaster from Harrow, later became the second Headmaster of the school. Headmaster
                   Arthur Foot believed passionately in the importance of social service and on the first Founder’s
                    Day declared the following in his speech:></p>
